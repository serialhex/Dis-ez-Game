# Dis ez Game

An experiment in making games!

## Objective

Find a good language & set of libraries that we are comfortable with for making games!!

## How?

By making the `standard game`: Zelda-like top-down action-adventure game!  To do this we need to accomplish certain goals, such as:
* Basic map & player with collision detection
* Player attack
* Static, killable enemy
* Basic enemy a.i.
* BREAKABLES! (pots to smash, bushes to kill, etc...)
